# :neutral_face: Motivation 
The reason to start creating my own JS slider is because I couldn't find a slider that works smoothly on desktop browser and mobile device. There are a ton of wonderfull sliders out there such as [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/), [Pure React Carousel](https://express-labs.github.io/pure-react-carousel/) and a lot, but they are all not dynamic enough, especially when use on iOS (the animation not works sometime).
